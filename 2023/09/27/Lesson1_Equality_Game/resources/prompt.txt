Hello, can you help me generate a CSV with scenarios related to the Equality Act? Specifically, can you provide one scenario for each of the nine protected characteristics, and then five additional scenarios illustrating exemptions under the act? Please include the following columns: prosecuting party, accused party, scenario, breaksAct/exempt, direct/indirect discrimination if breaksAct or explanation of exemption if exempt, and area where the act is being applied (e.g. work, services, etc.). Please choose a random number, then use that to act as a seed for your response. Thank you!
